# Android-Runtime-Permissions
New Permission request mechanism for Android 6.0

Android 6.0 introduced a new request permission mechanism like IOS devices. In this small project we
implement Runtime Permission REquest Abstract Activity Pattern to request permissions. It saves us
from violating Single Responsibility Principle and enables us to write cleaner and more readable code.
